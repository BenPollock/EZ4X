== EZ4X (Easy Forex)

EZ4X is a graphical, automatic forex trader, that uses a user's chosen technical indicators and risk tolerance to automatically execute trades on a currency pair.

It is currently under development as part of my Year 4 Capstone project.  You can see the demo available at http://ez4x.herokuapp.com.
